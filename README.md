# AlternateNotebooks
research into things other than Jupyter Notebook

### Group Research

Divide into groups of three. 

Talk with an instructor to lock in your groups.

Look into the various notebook tech below, decide on one of them, and talk to the instructor about it.

Once given the go-ahead, research the tech and talk about it within your group. Gather lots of info about the tech, putting links to articles, tutorials, and the tech itself into your copy of this repo. (Make a folder in the repo, name it after your tech, and add all your materials there.)

### Presentation

Create a simple Google Slides presentation on the notebook projects/products your group reviewed. Compare and contrast against Jupyter Notebook. Your preso should be about 6 slides long:
- 1: Describe the tech, who built it, what its key features are
- 2: Explain the special features that the creators stress
- 3: Compare it to Jupyter
- 4: Contrast against Jupyter, what does it do that is really different
- 5: Explain where you might use this instead of Jupyter
- 6: Give a recommendation as to whether or not you'd like to use it.

### Demonstration

Develop a quick, 5 minute demo of the tech, showing what it looks like. 

#### Places to start

These ones that can use languages like Python (and others).

- https://zeppelin.apache.org/
- https://polynote.org/

There may be others more interesting to you and your group. Just clear it with the instructor first.

These are different. How? And Why?

You get 1,000,000 extra points (each) if you find a notebook tech not listed here(!).
